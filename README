1. Define Key Features
Charting and Basic Indicators: Focus on building a chart with essential technical indicators like moving averages, RSI, and MACD.
Historical Data Visualization: You could start with a library like Plotly (Python) or Chart.js (JavaScript) to create interactive charts.
Custom Scripting: For simplicity, consider allowing basic customization of indicators through simple parameter inputs instead of implementing a full scripting language.
Local or Limited Real-Time Data: For real-time data, you can use free APIs from sources like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or IEX Cloud for stocks, forex, or crypto.
2. Tech Stack
Frontend: Use React (or just vanilla HTML/CSS with JavaScript) to display charts if you’re familiar with web development.
Backend: Consider a minimal backend (Node.js or Python Flask) to fetch and process data.
Database (Optional): If you want to store historical data, you could use SQLite or a simple file-based storage like JSON or CSV.
3. Core Components
Data Fetching: Set up functions to pull data from APIs at intervals or on demand.
Chart Display: Use libraries like Plotly (Python) or D3.js for interactive charts.
Technical Indicators: Use simple calculations to add a few core indicators. For example, moving averages can be calculated easily with Python’s Pandas.
Basic Alerts (Optional): Set up alerts for certain conditions, like when a stock reaches a price level. This could be achieved with simple if-statements checking the current data.
